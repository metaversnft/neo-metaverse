# neo-metaverse
A virtual 3D world for the NEO N3 blockchain with integrated real-time video conferencing

Metathon Contest Entry (Metaverse Hackathon)

**NOTE**: The majority of the source code files related to the Neo3D Live virtual world are in the `server/route`, `server/public`, and `server/views` directories.  The code in the `server/src` directory is code that was derived from a DolbyIO sample to interface with the DolbyIO API and SDK.  That service is used by Neo3D Live to provide integrated video conferencing in the ThreeJS driven virtual world.

(This README is just a stub until the real README is created, which will have instructions on how to set up your own virtual world and get started.)
